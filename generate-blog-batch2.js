      <h2>Why You Need a Mortgage Calculator</h2>
      <p>Buying a home is the biggest financial decision most people make. A mortgage calculator helps you understand what you can afford before you start house hunting. With mortgage rates changing daily, having accurate payment estimates is crucial.</p>
      
      <h2>What Makes a Good Mortgage Calculator?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accurate payment breakdowns</strong> - Principal, interest, taxes, insurance (PITI)</li>
        <li><strong>Amortization schedules</strong> - See exactly where your money goes each month</li>
        <li><strong>Extra payment scenarios</strong> - Calculate how much you save by paying extra</li>
        <li><strong>Rate comparisons</strong> - Test different interest rates side by side</li>
        <li><strong>Total cost breakdown</strong> - See lifetime interest paid</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Use a Mortgage Calculator</h2>
      <p>Using our <a href="/calc/mortgage.html">mortgage calculator</a> is simple:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter your home price</li>
        <li>Add your down payment amount (typically 10-20%)</li>
        <li>Input the interest rate (check current rates online)</li>
        <li>Choose loan term (15 or 30 years most common)</li>
        <li>Add property taxes and insurance if known</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Mortgage Calculator Tips</h2>
      <p><strong>Test different down payments:</strong> A 20% down payment avoids PMI (private mortgage insurance), saving you $100-200/month.</p>
      <p><strong>Compare 15 vs 30 year loans:</strong> 15-year mortgages have higher monthly payments but save massive amounts in total interest.</p>
      <p><strong>Calculate extra payments:</strong> Paying just $100 extra per month can shave years off your mortgage and save tens of thousands in interest.</p>

      <h2>Current Mortgage Trends (2026)</h2>
      <p>Interest rates fluctuate based on Federal Reserve policy and economic conditions. Always check multiple lenders and use a calculator to compare total costs, not just monthly payments.</p>

    description: 'Calculate how much house you can afford based on your income, debt, and down payment. Use the 28/36 rule and get pre-approved with confidence.',

    content: `
      <h2>The 28/36 Rule for Home Affordability</h2>
      <p>Lenders use the <strong>28/36 rule</strong> to determine how much house you can afford:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>28%</strong> - Your monthly housing costs (mortgage, taxes, insurance) should not exceed 28% of gross monthly income</li>
        <li><strong>36%</strong> - Your total debt payments (housing + car loans + credit cards + student loans) should not exceed 36% of gross income</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick Affordability Calculator</h2>
      <p>Here's a simple formula: <strong>Annual income × 3 = Maximum home price</strong></p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>$75,000 income → $225,000 max home price</li>
        <li>$100,000 income → $300,000 max home price</li>
        <li>$150,000 income → $450,000 max home price</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This assumes a 20% down payment and moderate debt. Use our <a href="/calc/mortgage.html">mortgage calculator</a> for exact numbers.</p>

      <h2>Factors That Affect Affordability</h2>
      <h3>1. Down Payment</h3>
      <p>Larger down payments mean smaller monthly payments and better interest rates. Aim for 20% to avoid PMI.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Interest Rate</h3>
      <p>A 1% difference in rate can change your monthly payment by hundreds of dollars. Even small rate differences matter on large loans.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Existing Debt</h3>
      <p>Car loans, student loans, and credit card debt reduce how much house you can afford. Pay down debt before buying.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Property Taxes & Insurance</h3>
      <p>These vary by location. High-tax states like NJ and IL can add $500-1000/month to housing costs.</p>

      <h2>Hidden Costs of Homeownership</h2>
      <p>Don't forget these expenses when budgeting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Budget 1-2% of home value annually ($3,000-6,000/year on a $300k home)</li>
        <li><strong>Utilities:</strong> Electric, gas, water, trash ($200-400/month)</li>
        <li><strong>HOA fees:</strong> $50-500/month depending on location</li>
        <li><strong>Closing costs:</strong> 2-5% of purchase price upfront</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Get Pre-Approved First</h2>
      <p>Before house hunting, get pre-approved by a lender. This shows sellers you're serious and helps you avoid falling in love with a house you can't afford.</p>

      <p>Use our <a href="/calc/mortgage.html">mortgage calculator</a> to estimate your payment, then get pre-approved for that amount.</p>

      <h2>What is Compound Interest?</h2>
      <p>Compound interest is <strong>"interest on interest"</strong> - you earn returns not just on your initial investment, but also on all the interest you've already earned. Einstein allegedly called it "the eighth wonder of the world."</p>

      <h2>The Power of Compounding</h2>
      <p>See the magic of compound interest:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>$10,000 at 8% for 10 years</strong> = $21,589 (you earned $11,589)</li>
        <li><strong>$10,000 at 8% for 20 years</strong> = $46,610 (you earned $36,610)</li>
        <li><strong>$10,000 at 8% for 30 years</strong> = $100,627 (you earned $90,627)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Notice how the last 10 years earned more than the first 20 years combined? That's compounding.</p>

      <h2>How to Use a Compound Interest Calculator</h2>
      <p>Our <a href="/calc/compound-interest.html">compound interest calculator</a> shows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>How much your investment will grow over time</li>
        <li>How much you'll contribute vs. how much interest you'll earn</li>
        <li>The impact of different interest rates</li>
        <li>How regular monthly contributions accelerate growth</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
      <h3>Retirement Planning</h3>
      <p>If you invest $500/month starting at age 25 with 8% average returns, you'll have <strong>$1.7 million</strong> by age 65. Start at 35? Only $700k. Time is your biggest advantage.</p>

      <h3>Emergency Fund</h3>
      <p>Keep 3-6 months expenses in a high-yield savings account (currently 4-5% APY). On a $10,000 emergency fund, that's $400-500/year in free money.</p>

      <h3>College Savings</h3>
      <p>$300/month in a 529 plan from birth to age 18 at 7% = $130,000 for college. Total contributions: $64,800. Interest earned: $65,200.</p>

      <h2>Compound Interest Formula</h2>
      <p>For the mathematically curious:</p>
      <p><code>A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)</code></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A</strong> = Final amount</li>
        <li><strong>P</strong> = Principal (initial investment)</li>
        <li><strong>r</strong> = Annual interest rate (decimal)</li>
        <li><strong>n</strong> = Times compounded per year</li>
        <li><strong>t</strong> = Years</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pro Tips</h2>
      <p><strong>Start early:</strong> Every year you delay costs you exponentially in future returns.</p>
      <p><strong>Contribute regularly:</strong> $100/month beats $1,200 once a year due to dollar-cost averaging.</p>
      <p><strong>Reinvest dividends:</strong> Always choose automatic dividend reinvestment in your brokerage account.</p>
      <p><strong>Avoid fees:</strong> A 1% management fee can cost you hundreds of thousands over a lifetime. Use low-cost index funds.</p>

      <h2>Why You Need a Strong Password Generator</h2>
      <p>Weak passwords are the #1 cause of account hacks. "Password123" or your dog's name won't cut it in 2026. Hackers use automated tools that can crack simple passwords in seconds.</p>

      <h2>What Makes a Password Strong?</h2>
      <p>A secure password has:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>At least 12 characters</strong> (longer is better - aim for 16+)</li>
        <li><strong>Mix of uppercase and lowercase letters</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Numbers and symbols</strong> (!@#$%^&*)</li>
        <li><strong>No dictionary words</strong> or personal information</li>
        <li><strong>Unique for each account</strong> - never reuse passwords</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Use Our Password Generator</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose your desired password length (we recommend 16+ characters)</li>
        <li>Select character types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols</li>
        <li>Click "Generate Password"</li>
        <li>Copy to clipboard and save in a password manager</li>

      <h2>Password Security Best Practices</h2>
      <h3>1. Use a Password Manager</h3>
      <p>Don't remember passwords - let software do it. Password managers like <strong>1Password</strong>, <strong>Bitwarden</strong>, or <strong>Dashlane</strong> store all your passwords encrypted and auto-fill them on websites.</p>

      <h3>2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>
      <p>Even if someone steals your password, 2FA adds a second layer of protection. Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy.</p>

      <h3>3. Never Reuse Passwords</h3>
      <p>If one site gets hacked and you reuse passwords, hackers try that password on other sites. One breach = all accounts compromised.</p>

      <h3>4. Change Passwords After Breaches</h3>
      <p>Check <strong>HaveIBeenPwned.com</strong> to see if your email was in a data breach. If yes, change those passwords immediately.</p>

      <h2>Common Password Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>❌ Using "password", "123456", "qwerty"</li>
        <li>❌ Personal info: birthdays, pet names, addresses</li>
        <li>❌ Simple patterns: "asdfgh", "987654321"</li>
        <li>❌ Writing passwords on sticky notes</li>
        <li>❌ Sharing passwords over email or text</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Long to Crack Your Password?</h2>
      <p>With modern computers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>8 characters, lowercase only:</strong> Cracked instantly</li>
        <li><strong>8 characters, mixed case + numbers:</strong> 8 hours</li>
        <li><strong>12 characters, mixed case + numbers + symbols:</strong> 34,000 years</li>
        <li><strong>16 characters, mixed case + numbers + symbols:</strong> 1 trillion years</li>
      </ul>

    keywords: 'bmi calculator, body mass index calculator, bmi chart, ideal weight calculator',
    content: `
      <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
      <p>BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It's used by doctors worldwide to categorize weight status and assess health risks.</p>

      <h2>BMI Categories</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Underweight:</strong> BMI less than 18.5</li>
        <li><strong>Normal weight:</strong> BMI 18.5 - 24.9</li>
        <li><strong>Overweight:</strong> BMI 25 - 29.9</li>
        <li><strong>Obese:</strong> BMI 30 or higher</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Calculate BMI</h2>
      <p><strong>Metric formula:</strong> BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)²</p>
      <p><strong>Imperial formula:</strong> BMI = (weight (lbs) / height (inches)²) × 703</p>

      <p>Or just use our <a href="/calc/bmi.html">free BMI calculator</a> - no math required.</p>

      <h2>Is BMI Accurate?</h2>
      <p>BMI is a useful screening tool, but has limitations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Doesn't account for muscle mass:</strong> Athletes may have high BMI but low body fat</li>
        <li><strong>Doesn't measure body fat directly:</strong> Someone with normal BMI can still have high body fat percentage</li>
        <li><strong>Varies by age and gender:</strong> Older adults and women naturally have more body fat</li>
        <li><strong>Doesn't consider fat distribution:</strong> Belly fat is more dangerous than hip/thigh fat</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Better Metrics Than BMI</h2>
      <p>For a more complete picture of health, also check:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Waist circumference:</strong> Men &lt;40", Women &lt;35" (lower diabetes/heart disease risk)</li>
        <li><strong>Body fat percentage:</strong> Measured by calipers, DEXA scan, or bioelectrical impedance</li>
        <li><strong>Waist-to-hip ratio:</strong> Measure waist and hips, divide waist by hips (should be &lt;0.9 for men, &lt;0.85 for women)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Healthy BMI Ranges by Age</h2>
      <p>While 18.5-24.9 is the standard "normal" range, research shows slightly different optimal ranges by age:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ages 20-39:</strong> 19-24</li>
        <li><strong>Ages 40-59:</strong> 20-25</li>
        <li><strong>Ages 60+:</strong> 22-27</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Improve Your BMI</h2>
      <h3>If You're Overweight/Obese:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Aim to lose 1-2 lbs per week (safe, sustainable rate)</li>
        <li>Create a calorie deficit of 500-1000 calories/day</li>
        <li>Combine diet with exercise (cardio + strength training)</li>
        <li>Track calories with apps like MyFitnessPal</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>If You're Underweight:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Eat more calorie-dense foods (nuts, avocados, whole milk)</li>
        <li>Add protein shakes between meals</li>
        <li>Strength train to build muscle mass</li>
        <li>See a doctor to rule out underlying conditions</li>
